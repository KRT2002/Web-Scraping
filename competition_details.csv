Read on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you‚Äôre ready to start competing, click on the ""Join Competition button to create an account and gain access to the competition data. Then check out Alexis Cook‚Äôs Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!
The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
Recommended Tutorial
We highly recommend Alexis Cook‚Äôs Titanic Tutorial that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and this starter notebook to get started.

What Data Will I Use in This Competition?
In this competition, you‚Äôll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.
Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù.
The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the ‚Äúground truth‚Äù for each passenger. It‚Äôs your job to predict these outcomes.
Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.
Check out the ‚ÄúData‚Äù tab to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you‚Äôve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.
How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle

Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. You are being asked to predict if the person has one or more of any of the three medical conditions (Class 1), or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). You will create a model trained on measurements of health characteristics.
To determine if someone has these medical conditions requires a long and intrusive process to collect information from patients. With predictive models, we can shorten this process and keep patient details private by collecting key characteristics relative to the conditions, then encoding these characteristics.
Your work will help researchers discover the relationship between measurements of certain characteristics and potential patient conditions.
Context
They say age is just a number but a whole host of health issues come with aging. From heart disease and dementia to hearing loss and arthritis, aging is a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. The growing field of bioinformatics includes research into interventions that can help slow and reverse biological aging and prevent major age-related ailments. Data science could have a role to play in developing new methods to solve problems with diverse data, even if the number of samples is small.
Currently, models like XGBoost and random forest are used to predict medical conditions yet the models' performance is not good enough. Dealing with critical problems where lives are on the line, models need to make correct predictions reliably and consistently between different cases.
Founded in 2015, competition host InVitro Cell Research, LLC (ICR) is a privately funded company focused on regenerative and preventive personalized medicine. Their offices and labs in the greater New York City area offer state-of-the-art research space. InVitro Cell Research's Scientists are what set them apart, helping guide and defining their mission of researching how to repair aging people fast.
In this competition, you‚Äôll work with measurements of health characteristic data to solve critical problems in bioinformatics. Based on minimal training, you‚Äôll create a model to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions, with an aim to improve on existing methods.
You could help advance the growing field of bioinformatics and explore new methods to solve complex problems with diverse data.

Imagine standing at the check-out counter at the grocery store with a long line behind you and the cashier not-so-quietly announces that your card has been declined. In this moment, you probably aren‚Äôt thinking about the data science that determined your fate.
Embarrassed, and certain you have the funds to cover everything needed for an epic nacho party for 50 of your closest friends, you try your card again. Same result. As you step aside and allow the cashier to tend to the next customer, you receive a text message from your bank. ‚ÄúPress 1 if you really tried to spend $500 on cheddar cheese.‚Äù
While perhaps cumbersome (and often embarrassing) in the moment, this fraud prevention system is actually saving consumers millions of dollars per year. Researchers from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) want to improve this figure, while also improving the customer experience. With higher accuracy fraud detection, you can get on with your chips without the hassle.
IEEE-CIS works across a variety of AI and machine learning areas, including deep neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence. Today they‚Äôre partnering with the world‚Äôs leading payment service company, Vesta Corporation, seeking the best solutions for fraud prevention industry, and now you are invited to join the challenge.

Note: This is one of the two complementary competitions that together comprise the M5 forecasting challenge. Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition
How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods you‚Äôre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.
The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.
In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the world‚Äôs largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.
If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implications.

Nothing ruins the thrill of buying a brand new car more quickly than seeing your new insurance bill. The sting‚Äôs even more painful when you know you‚Äôre a good driver. It doesn‚Äôt seem fair that you have to pay so much if you‚Äôve been cautious on the road for years.
Porto Seguro, one of Brazil‚Äôs largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, completely agrees. Inaccuracies in car insurance company‚Äôs claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.
In this competition, you‚Äôre challenged to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they‚Äôre looking to Kaggle‚Äôs machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers."

Whether out at a restaurant or buying tickets to a concert, modern life counts on the convenience of a credit card to make daily purchases. It saves us from carrying large amounts of cash and also can advance a full purchase that can be paid over time. How do card issuers know we‚Äôll pay back what we charge? That‚Äôs a complex problem with many existing solutions‚Äîand even more potential improvements, to be explored in this competition.
Credit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. Current models exist to help manage risk. But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use.
American Express is a globally integrated payments company. The largest payment card issuer in the world, they provide customers with access to products, insights, and experiences that enrich lives and build business success.
In this competition, you‚Äôll apply your machine learning skills to predict credit default. Specifically, you will leverage an industrial scale data set to build a machine learning model that challenges the current model in production. Training, validation, and testing datasets include time-series behavioral data and anonymized customer profile information. You're free to explore any technique to create the most powerful model, from creating features to using the data in a more organic way within a model.
If successful, you'll help create a better customer experience for cardholders by making it easier to be approved for a credit card. Top solutions could challenge the credit default prediction model used by the world's largest payment card issuer‚Äîearning you cash prizes, the opportunity to interview with American Express, and potentially a rewarding new career."

Discussing things you care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.
The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google (both a part of Alphabet) are working on tools to help improve online conversation. One area of focus is the study of negative online behaviors, like toxic comments (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). So far they‚Äôve built a range of publicly available models served through the Perspective API, including toxicity. But the current models still make errors, and they don‚Äôt allow users to select which types of toxicity they‚Äôre interested in finding (e.g. some platforms may be fine with profanity, but not with other types of toxic content).
In this competition, you‚Äôre challenged to build a multi-headed model that‚Äôs capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective‚Äôs current models. You‚Äôll be using a dataset of comments from Wikipedia‚Äôs talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.

Forecasting earthquakes is one of the most important problems in Earth science because of their devastating consequences. Current scientific studies related to earthquake forecasting focus on three key points: when the event will occur, where it will occur, and how large it will be.
In this competition, you will address when the earthquake will take place. Specifically, you‚Äôll predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data.
If this challenge is solved and the physics are ultimately shown to scale from the laboratory to the field, researchers will have the potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure.
This challenge is hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory which enhances national security by ensuring the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, developing technologies to reduce threats from weapons of mass destruction, and solving problems related to energy, environment, infrastructure, health, and global security concerns.

According to Epsilon research, 80% of customers are more likely to do business with you if you provide personalized service. Banking is no exception.
The digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner‚Ä¶ and often before they¬¥ve even realized they need the service. In their 3rd Kaggle competition, Santander Group aims to go a step beyond recognizing that there is a need to provide a customer a financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before.
In this competition, Santander Group is asking Kagglers to help them identify the value of transactions for each potential customer. This is a first step that Santander needs to nail in order to personalize their services at scale."
Optiver - Trading at the Close,Optiver,"$100,000","20,564 Entrants","Description

Stock exchanges are fast-paced, high-stakes environments where every second counts. The intensity escalates as the trading day approaches its end, peaking in the critical final ten minutes. These moments, often characterised by heightened volatility and rapid price fluctuations, play a pivotal role in shaping the global economic narrative for the day.
Each trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange concludes with the Nasdaq Closing Cross auction. This process establishes the official closing prices for securities listed on the exchange. These closing prices serve as key indicators for investors, analysts and other market participants in evaluating the performance of individual securities and the market as a whole.
Within this complex financial landscape operates Optiver, a leading global electronic market maker. Fueled by technological innovation, Optiver trades a vast array of financial instruments, such as derivatives, cash equities, ETFs, bonds, and foreign currencies, offering competitive, two-sided prices for thousands of these instruments on major exchanges worldwide.
In the last ten minutes of the Nasdaq exchange trading session, market makers like Optiver merge traditional order book data with auction book data. This ability to consolidate information from both sources is critical for providing the best prices to all market participants.
In this competition, you are challenged to develop a model capable of predicting the closing price movements for hundreds of Nasdaq listed stocks using data from the order book and the closing auction of the stock. Information from the auction can be used to adjust prices, assess supply and demand dynamics, and identify trading opportunities.
Your model can contribute to the consolidation of signals from the auction and order book, leading to improved market efficiency and accessibility, particularly during the intense final ten minutes of trading. You'll also get firsthand experience in handling real-world data science problems, similar to those faced by traders, quantitative researchers and engineers at Optiver."
Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction,Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard,"$30,000","17,670 Entrants","Description

keyboard_arrow_up
The Connectivity Map, a project within the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), and the NIH Common Funds Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), present this challenge with the goal of advancing drug development through improvements to MoA prediction algorithms.
What is the Mechanism of Action (MoA) of a drug? And why is it important?
In the past, scientists derived drugs from natural products or were inspired by traditional remedies. Very common drugs, such as paracetamol, known in the US as acetaminophen, were put into clinical use decades before the biological mechanisms driving their pharmacological activities were understood. Today, with the advent of more powerful technologies, drug discovery has changed from the serendipitous approaches of the past to a more targeted model based on an understanding of the underlying biological mechanism of a disease. In this new framework, scientists seek to identify a protein target associated with a disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. As a shorthand to describe the biological activity of a given molecule, scientists assign a label referred to as mechanism-of-action or MoA for short.
How do we determine the MoAs of a new drug?
One approach is to treat a sample of human cells with the drug and then analyze the cellular responses with algorithms that search for similarity to known patterns in large genomic databases, such as libraries of gene expression or cell viability patterns of drugs with known MoAs.
In this competition, you will have access to a unique dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. The data is based on a new technology that measures simultaneously (within the same samples) human cells‚Äô responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types (thus solving the problem of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug). In addition, you will have access to MoA annotations for more than 5,000 drugs in this dataset.
As is customary, the dataset has been split into testing and training subsets. Hence, your task is to use the training dataset to develop an algorithm that automatically labels each case in the test set as one or more MoA classes. Note that since drugs can have multiple MoA annotations, the task is formally a multi-label classification problem.
How to evaluate the accuracy of a solution?
Based on the MoA annotations, the accuracy of solutions will be evaluated on the average value of the logarithmic loss function applied to each drug-MoA annotation pair.
If successful, you‚Äôll help to develop an algorithm to predict a compound‚Äôs MoA given its cellular signature, thus helping scientists advance the drug discovery process.

Can you help build a model to identify which essay was written by middle and high school students, and which was written using a large language model? With the spread of LLMs, many people fear they will replace or alter work that would usually be done by humans. Educators are especially concerned about their impact on students‚Äô skill development, though many remain optimistic that LLMs will ultimately be a useful tool to help students improve their writing skills.
At the forefront of academic concerns about LLMs is their potential to enable plagiarism. LLMs are trained on a massive dataset of text and code, which means that they are able to generate text that is very similar to human-written text. For example, students could use LLMs to generate essays that are not their own, missing crucial learning keystones. Your work on this competition can help identify telltale LLM artifacts and advance the state of the art in LLM text detection. By using texts of moderate length on a variety of subjects and multiple, unknown generative models, we aim to replicate typical detection scenarios and incentivize learning features that generalize across models.

‚ÄúBuy low, sell high.‚Äù It sounds so easy‚Ä¶.
In reality, trading for profit has always been a difficult problem to solve, even more so in today‚Äôs fast-moving and complex financial markets. Electronic trading allows for thousands of transactions to occur within a fraction of a second, resulting in nearly unlimited opportunities to potentially find and take advantage of price differences in real time.
In a perfectly efficient market, buyers and sellers would have all the agency and information needed to make rational trading decisions. As a result, products would always remain at their ‚Äúfair values‚Äù and never be undervalued or overpriced. However, financial markets are not perfectly efficient in the real world.
Developing trading strategies to identify and take advantage of inefficiencies is challenging. Even if a strategy is profitable now, it may not be in the future, and market volatility makes it impossible to predict the profitability of any given trade with certainty. As a result, it can be hard to distinguish good luck from having made a good trading decision.
In the first three months of this challenge, you will build your own quantitative trading model to maximize returns using market data from a major global stock exchange. Next, you‚Äôll test the predictiveness of your models against future market returns and receive feedback on the leaderboard.
Your challenge will be to use the historical data, mathematical tools, and technological tools at your disposal to create a model that gets as close to certainty as possible. You will be presented with a number of potential trading opportunities, which your model must choose whether to accept or reject.
In general, if one is able to generate a highly predictive model which selects the right trades to execute, they would also be playing an important role in sending the market signals that push prices closer to ‚Äúfair‚Äù values. That is, a better model will mean the market will be more efficient going forward. However, developing good models will be challenging for many reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation.
Jane Street has spent decades developing their own trading models and machine learning solutions to identify profitable opportunities and quickly decide whether to execute trades. These models help Jane Street trade thousands of financial products each day across 200 trading venues around the world.
Admittedly, this challenge far oversimplifies the depth of the quantitative problems Jane Streeters work on daily, and Jane Street is happy with the performance of its existing trading model for this particular question. However, there‚Äôs nothing like a good puzzle, and this challenge will hopefully serve as a fun introduction to a type of data science problem that a Jane Streeter might tackle on a daily basis. Jane Street looks forward to seeing the new and creative approaches the Kaggle community will take to solve this trading challenge.

keyboard_arrow_up
As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.
Existing methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. This suffers from being labor-intensive, low-supply and costly. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.
In this competition, we introduce a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.
Your task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.

The absence of a credit history might mean a lot of things, including young age or a preference for cash. Without traditional data, someone with little to no credit history is likely to be denied. Consumer finance providers must accurately determine which clients can repay a loan and which cannot and data is key. If data science could help better predict one‚Äôs repayment capabilities, loans might become more accessible to those who may benefit from them the most.
Currently, consumer finance providers use various statistical and machine learning methods to predict loan risk. These models are generally called scorecards. In the real world, clients' behaviors change constantly, so every scorecard must be updated regularly, which takes time. The scorecard's stability in the future is critical, as a sudden drop in performance means that loans will be issued to worse clients on average. The core of the issue is that loan providers aren't able to spot potential problems any sooner than the first due dates of those loans are observable. Given the time it takes to redevelop, validate, and implement the scorecard, stability is highly desirable. There is a trade-off between the stability of the model and its performance, and a balance must be reached before deployment.
Founded in 1997, competition host Home Credit is an international consumer finance provider focusing on responsible lending primarily to people with little or no credit history. Home Credit broadens financial inclusion for the unbanked population by creating a positive and safe borrowing experience. We previously ran a competition with Kaggle that you can see here.
Your work in helping to assess potential clients' default risks will enable consumer finance providers to accept more loan applications. This may improve the lives of people who have historically been denied due to lack of credit history."

Volatility is one of the most prominent terms you‚Äôll hear on any trading floor ‚Äì and for good reason. In financial markets, volatility captures the amount of fluctuation in prices. High volatility is associated to periods of market turbulence and to large price swings, while low volatility describes more calm and quiet markets. For trading firms like Optiver, accurately predicting volatility is essential for the trading of options, whose price is directly related to the volatility of the underlying product.
As a leading global electronic market maker, Optiver is dedicated to continuously improving financial markets, creating better access and prices for options, ETFs, cash equities, bonds and foreign currencies on numerous exchanges around the world. Optiver‚Äôs teams have spent countless hours building sophisticated models that predict volatility and continuously generate fairer options prices for end investors. However, an industry-leading pricing algorithm can never stop evolving, and there is no better place than Kaggle to help Optiver take its model to the next level.
In the first three months of this competition, you‚Äôll build models that predict short-term volatility for hundreds of stocks across different sectors. You will have hundreds of millions of rows of highly granular financial data at your fingertips, with which you'll design your model forecasting volatility over 10-minute periods. Your models will be evaluated against real market data collected in the three-month evaluation period after training.
Through this competition, you'll gain invaluable insight into volatility and financial market structure. You'll also get a better understanding of the sort of data science problems Optiver has faced for decades. We look forward to seeing the creative approaches the Kaggle community will apply to this ever complex but exciting trading challenge.

Zillow‚Äôs Zestimate home valuation has shaken up the U.S. real estate industry since first released 11 years ago.
A home is often the largest and most expensive purchase a person makes in his or her lifetime. Ensuring homeowners have a trusted way to monitor this asset is incredibly important. The Zestimate was created to give consumers as much information as possible about homes and the housing market, marking the first time consumers had access to this type of home value information at no cost.
‚ÄúZestimates‚Äù are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property. And, by continually improving the median margin of error (from 14% at the onset to 5% today), Zillow has since become established as one of the largest, most trusted marketplaces for real estate information in the U.S. and a leading example of impactful machine learning.
Zillow Prize, a competition with a one million dollar grand prize, is challenging the data science community to help push the accuracy of the Zestimate even further. Winning algorithms stand to impact the home values of 110M homes across the U.S.
In this million-dollar competition, participants will develop an algorithm that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes. The contest is structured into two rounds, the qualifying round which opens May 24, 2017 and the private round for the 100 top qualifying teams that opens on Feb 1st, 2018. In the qualifying round, you‚Äôll be building a model to improve the Zestimate residual error. In the final round, you‚Äôll build a home valuation algorithm from the ground up, using external data sources to help engineer new features that give your model an edge over the competition.
Because real estate transaction data is public information, there will be a three-month sales tracking period after each competition round closes where your predictions will be evaluated against the actual sale prices of the homes. The final leaderboard won‚Äôt be revealed until the close of the sales tracking period."

Spot Nuclei. Speed Cures.
Imagine speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders. The 2018 Data Science Bowl offers our most ambitious mission yet: create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection.
We‚Äôve all seen people suffer from diseases like cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and diabetes. Many have seen their loved ones pass away. Think how many lives would be transformed if cures came faster.
By automating nucleus detection, you could help unlock cures faster‚Äîfrom rare disorders to the common cold. Want a snapshot about the 2018 Data Science Bowl? View this video.
Why nuclei?
Identifying the cells‚Äô nuclei is the starting point for most analyses because most of the human body‚Äôs 30 trillion cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code that programs each cell. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work.
By participating, teams will work to automate the process of identifying nuclei, which will allow for more efficient drug testing, shortening the 10 years it takes for each new drug to come to market. Check out this video overview to find out more.
What will participants do?
Teams will create a computer model that can identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions. By observing patterns, asking questions, and building a model, participants will have a chance to push state-of-the-art technology farther.

Can machine learning identify the appropriate reading level of a passage of text, and help inspire learning? Reading is an essential skill for academic success. When students have access to engaging passages offering the right level of challenge, they naturally develop reading skills.
Currently, most educational texts are matched to readers using traditional readability methods or commercially available formulas. However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number or words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity. At the same time, commercially available formulas, such as Lexile, can be cost-prohibitive, lack suitable validation studies, and suffer from transparency issues when the formula's features aren't publicly available.
CommonLit, Inc., is a nonprofit education technology organization serving over 20 million teachers and students with free digital reading and writing lessons for grades 3-12. Together with Georgia State University, an R1 public research university in Atlanta, they are challenging Kagglers to improve readability rating methods.
In this competition, you‚Äôll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.
If successful, you'll aid administrators, teachers, and students. Literacy curriculum developers and teachers who choose passages will be able to quickly and accurately evaluate works for their classrooms. Plus, these formulas will become more accessible for all. Perhaps most importantly, students will benefit from feedback on the complexity and readability of their work, making it far easier to improve essential reading skills.

Q: How much does it cost to cool a skyscraper in the summer?
A: A lot! And not just in dollars, but in environmental impact.
Thankfully, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. The question is, are the improvements working? That‚Äôs where you come in. Under pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. The latter values have to come from a model. Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type or don‚Äôt work with different building types.
In this competition, you‚Äôll develop accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.

Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict monthly microbusiness density in a given area. You will develop an accurate model trained on U.S. county-level data.
Your work will help policymakers gain visibility into microbusinesses, a growing trend of very small entities. Additional information will enable new policies and programs to improve the success and impact of these smallest of businesses.
Context
American policy leaders strive to develop economies that are more inclusive and resilient to downturns. They're also aware that with advances in technology, entrepreneurship has never been more accessible than it is today. Whether to create a more appropriate work/life balance, to follow a passion, or due to loss of employment, studies have demonstrated that Americans increasingly choose to create businesses of their own to meet their financial goals. The challenge is that these ""microbusinesses"" are often too small or too new to show up in traditional economic data sources, making it nearly impossible for policymakers to study them. But data science could help fill in the gaps and provide insights into the factors associated these businesses.
Over the past few years the Venture Forward team at GoDaddy has worked hard to produce data assets about the tens of millions of microbusinesses in the United States. Microbusinesses are generally defined as businesses with an online presence and ten or fewer employees. GoDaddy has visibility into more than 20 million of them, owned by more than 10 million entrepreneurs. We've surveyed this universe of microbusiness owners for several years and have collected a great deal of information on them that you can access via our survey data here.
Current models leverage available internal and census data, use econometric approaches, and focus on understanding primary determinants. While these methods are adequate, there's potential to include additional data and using more advanced approaches to improve predictions and to better inform decision-making.
Competition host GoDaddy is the world‚Äôs largest services platform for entrepreneurs around the globe. They're on a mission to empower their worldwide community of 20+ million customers‚Äîand entrepreneurs everywhere‚Äîby giving them all the help and tools they need to grow online.
Your work will help better inform policymakers as they strive to make the world a better place for microbusiness entrepreneurs. This will have a real and substantial impact on communities across the country and will help our broader economy adapt to a constantly evolving world."

Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It's also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection‚Äîpotentially aided by data science‚Äîcan make treatment more effective.
Currently, dermatologists evaluate every one of a patient's moles to identify outlier lesions or ‚Äúugly ducklings‚Äù that are most likely to be melanoma. Existing AI approaches have not adequately considered this clinical frame of reference. Dermatologists could enhance their diagnostic accuracy if detection algorithms take into account ‚Äúcontextual‚Äù images within the same patient to determine which images represent a melanoma. If successful, classifiers would be more accurate and could better support dermatological clinic work.
As the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)'s mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. SIIM is joined by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis. The ISIC Archive contains the largest publicly available collection of quality-controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesions.
In this competition, you‚Äôll identify melanoma in images of skin lesions. In particular, you‚Äôll use images within the same patient and determine which are likely to represent a melanoma. Using patient-level contextual information may help the development of image analysis tools, which could better support clinical dermatologists.
Melanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people."

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

Several areas of Earth with large accumulations of oil and gas also have huge deposits of salt below the surface.
But unfortunately, knowing where large salt deposits are precisely is very difficult. Professional seismic imaging still requires expert human interpretation of salt bodies. This leads to very subjective, highly variable renderings. More alarmingly, it leads to potentially dangerous situations for oil and gas company drillers.
To create the most accurate seismic images and 3D renderings, TGS (the world‚Äôs leading geoscience data company) is hoping Kaggle‚Äôs machine learning community will be able to build an algorithm that automatically and accurately identifies if a subsurface target is salt or not."
Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification,Jigsaw/Conversation AI,"$65,000","16,710 Entrants","Description

keyboard_arrow_up
Can you help detect toxic comments ‚Äï and minimize unintended model bias? That's your challenge in this competition.
The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google (both part of Alphabet), builds technology to protect voices in conversation. A main area of focus is machine learning models that can identify toxicity in online conversations, where toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion.
Last year, in the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, you built multi-headed models to recognize toxicity and several subtypes of toxicity. This year's competition is a related challenge: building toxicity models that operate fairly across a diverse range of conversations.
Here‚Äôs the background: When the Conversation AI team first built toxicity models, they found that the models incorrectly learned to associate the names of frequently attacked identities with toxicity. Models predicted a high likelihood of toxicity for comments containing those identities (e.g. ""gay""), even when those comments were not actually toxic (such as ""I am a gay woman""). This happens because training data was pulled from available sources where unfortunately, certain identities are overwhelmingly referred to in offensive ways. Training a model from data with these imbalances risks simply mirroring those biases back to users.
In this competition, you're challenged to build a model that recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities. You'll be using a dataset labeled for identity mentions and optimizing a metric designed to measure unintended bias. Develop strategies to reduce unintended bias in machine learning models, and you'll help the Conversation AI team, and the entire industry, build models that work well for a wide range of conversations.

Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened.
Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospital‚Äôs ability to identify potential patients. Further, the solutions will be spread to other Ophthalmologists through the 4th Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) Symposium
Currently, Aravind technicians travel to these rural areas to capture images and then rely on highly trained doctors to review the images and provide diagnosis. Their goal is to scale their efforts through technology; to gain the ability to automatically screen images for disease and provide information on how severe the condition may be.
In this synchronous Kernels-only competition, you'll build a machine learning model to speed up disease detection. You‚Äôll work with thousands of images collected in rural areas to help identify diabetic retinopathy automatically. If successful, you will not only help to prevent lifelong blindness, but these models may be used to detect other sorts of diseases in the future, like glaucoma and macular degeneration.

As a global specialist in personal insurance, BNP Paribas Cardif serves 90 million clients in 36 countries across Europe, Asia and Latin America.
In a world shaped by the emergence of new uses and lifestyles, everything is going faster and faster. When facing unexpected events, customers expect their insurer to support them as soon as possible. However, claims management may require different levels of check before a claim can be approved and a payment can be made. With the new practices and behaviors generated by the digital economy, this process needs adaptation thanks to data science to meet the new needs and expectations of customers.
In this challenge, BNP Paribas Cardif is providing an anonymized database with two categories of claims:
claims for which approval could be accelerated leading to faster payments
claims for which additional information is required before approval
Kagglers are challenged to predict the category of a claim based on features available early in the process, helping BNP Paribas Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers."

From stethoscopes to tongue depressors, doctors rely on many tools to treat their patients. Physicians use electroencephalography with critically ill patients to detect seizures and other types of brain activity that can cause brain damage. You can learn about how doctors interpret these EEG signals in these videos:
EEG Talk - ACNS Critical Care EEG Terminology 2021 (Part 1) (Part 2) (Part 3) (Part 4) (Part 5)
Currently, EEG monitoring relies solely on manual analysis by specialized neurologists. While invaluable, this labor-intensive process is a major bottleneck. Not only can it be time-consuming, but manual review of EEG recordings is also expensive, prone to fatigue-related errors, and suffers from reliability issues between different reviewers, even when those reviewers are experts.
Competition host Sunstella Foundation was created in 2021 during the COVID pandemic to help minority graduate students in technology overcome challenges and celebrate their achievements. These students are vital to America's technology leadership and diversity. Through workshops, forums, and competitions, the Sunstella Foundation provides mentorship and career advice to support their success.
Sunstella Foundation is joined by Persyst, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, and the Clinical Data Animation Center (CDAC), whose research aims to help people preserve and enhance brain health.
Your work in automating EEG analysis will help doctors and brain researchers detect seizures and other types of brain activity that can cause brain damage, so that they can give treatments more quickly and accurately. The algorithms developed in this contest may also help researchers who are working to develop drugs to treat and prevent seizures.
There are six patterns of interest for this competition: seizure (SZ), generalized periodic discharges (GPD), lateralized periodic discharges (LPD), lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA), generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA), or ‚Äúother‚Äù. Detailed explanations of these patterns are available here.
The EEG segments used in this competition have been annotated, or classified, by a group of experts. In some cases experts completely agree about the correct label. On other cases the experts disagree. We call segments where there are high levels of agreement ‚Äúidealized‚Äù patterns. Cases where ~1/2 of experts give a label as ‚Äúother‚Äù and ~1/2 give one of the remaining five labels, we call ‚Äúproto patterns‚Äù. Cases where experts are approximately split between 2 of the 5 named patterns, we call ‚Äúedge cases‚Äù.
Examples of EEG Patterns with Different Levels of Expert Agreement:

Please refer to Data tab for full screen PDF page of each subfigure.
This figure shows selected examples of EEG patterns with different level of agreement. Rows are structured with the 1st row seizure, 2nd row LPDs, 3rd row GPDs, 4th row LRDA, and 5th row GRDA. Column-wise, examples of idealized forms of patterns are in the 1st column (A). These are patterns with uniform expert agreement. The 2nd column (B) are proto or partially formed patterns. About half of raters labeled these as one IIIC pattern and the other half labeled ‚ÄúOther‚Äù. The 3rd and 4th columns (C, D) are edge cases (about half of raters labeled these one IIIC pattern and half labeled them as another IIIC pattern).
For B-1 there is rhythmic delta activity with some admixed sharp discharges within the 10 second raw EEG, and the spectrogram shows that this segment may belong to the tail end of a seizure, thus disagreement between SZ and ‚ÄúOther‚Äù makes sense. B-2 shows frontal lateralized sharp transients at ~1Hz, but they have a reversed polarity, suggesting they may be coming from a non-cerebral source, thus the split between LPD and ‚ÄúOther‚Äù (artifact) makes sense. B-3 has diffused semi-rhythmic delta background with poorly formed low amplitude generalized periodic discharges with s shifting morphology making it a proto-GPD type pattern. B-4 shows semi-rhythmic delta activity with unstable morphology over the right hemisphere, a proto-LRDA pattern. B-5 shows a few waves of rhythmic delta activity with an unstable morphology and is poorly sustained, a proto-GRDA. C-1 shows 2Hz LPDs showing an evolution with increasing amplitude evolving underlying rhythmic activity, a pattern between LPDs and the beginning of a seizure, an edge-case. D-1 shows abundant GPDs on top of a suppressed background with frequency of 1-2Hz. The average over the 10-seconds is close to 1.5Hz, suggesting a seizure, another edge case. C-2 is split between LPDs and GPDs. The amplitude of the periodic discharges is higher over the right, but a reflection is also seen on the left. D-2 is tied between LPDs and LRDA. It shares some features of both; in the temporal derivations it looks more rhythmic whereas in the parasagittal derivations it looks periodic. C-3 is split between GPDs and LRDA. The ascending limb of the delta waves have a sharp morphology, and these periodic discharges are seen on both sides. The rhythmic delta appears to be of higher amplitude over the left, but there is some reflection of the activity on the left. D-3 is split between GPDs and GRDA. The ascending limb of the delta wave has a sharp morphology and there is asymmetry in slope between ascending and descending limbs making it an edge case. C-4 is split between LRDA and seizure. It shows 2Hz LRDA on the left, and the spectrogram shows that this segment may belong to the tail end of a seizure, an edge-case. D-4 is split between LRDA and GRDA. The rhythmic delta appears to be of higher amplitude over the left, but there is some reflection of the activity on the right. C-5 is split between GRDA and seizure. It shows potentially evolving rhythmic delta activity with poorly formed embedded epileptiform discharges, a pattern between GRDA and seizure, an edge-case. D-5 is split between GRDA and LPDs. There is generalized rhythmic delta activity, while the activity on the right is somewhat higher amplitude and contains poorly formed epileptiform discharges suggestive of LPDs, an edge-case. Note: Recording regions of the EEG electrodes are abbreviated as LL = left lateral; RL = right lateral; LP = left parasagittal; RP = right parasagittal."
